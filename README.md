 Privacy Policy for Free Vocabulary App

**Last Updated:** Jun 20, 2025

Thank you for using Free Vocabulary App ("the App", "we", "us", "our")! This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information We Collect

*   **User-Provided Vocabulary Files (CSV):** The core functionality of the App involves you selecting Comma Separated Value (.csv) files from your device's storage using the Android Storage Access Framework. These files contain the vocabulary lists you wish to create, manage, and train with. The App reads data from these files and can save changes back to these files only at your explicit direction and chosen location on your device.

* Camera Usage for Optical Character Recognition (OCR): The App requests camera permission for one specific purpose: to allow you to take a picture of text (e.g., from a book or a document) to be converted into a vocabulary list. This feature is initiated entirely by you.
    
    *   **On-Device Processing:** The image you capture is processed directly on your device by the Google ML Kit library to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
    *   **No Storage or Transmission:** The captured image is **not** stored on your device after the text has been recognized, and it is **never** transmitted, shared, or uploaded to us or any third-party servers. It is used momentarily for the OCR process and then immediately discarded.

*   **Firebase Analytics:** We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how the App is being used and to improve its functionality and user experience. This data may include:
    *   Device information (such as device model, operating system version)
    *   App usage patterns (such as features used, session duration)
    *   Anonymized user identifiers generated by Firebase.
    *   General location data (e.g., country), if location services are enabled on your device for apps in general.
    *   For more information on how Google collects and uses data with Firebase, please review Google's Privacy & Terms: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and the Firebase Privacy Policy: [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).
*   **No Personal Identification Information for Local Use:** For the local CSV file functionality, the App does not require you to provide any directly personally identifiable information like your name, email address, or phone number to use its core features.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

*   **To Provide App Functionality:**
    *   Vocabulary data from your selected CSV files is used to display words, allow you to edit them, and facilitate the training process within the App.
    *   Changes you make are saved back to your selected CSV file on your device when you explicitly choose to save.
*   **To Improve Our App:** Anonymous usage data collected via Firebase Analytics helps us understand user behavior, identify popular features, diagnose problems, and make informed decisions about future development.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

*   **User-Selected CSV Files:** Your vocabulary files remain on your device and are **not** automatically shared with us or any third parties by the App. You have full control over these files.
*   **Firebase Analytics Data:** Anonymized and aggregated data collected by Firebase Analytics may be shared with Google as per their terms of service. We use this data internally for app improvement purposes only.
*   **No Sale of Data:** We do not sell any personal information or user-provided data to third parties.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App, or protect against legal liability.

## 4. Data Retention and Management (Your Rights)

*   **User-Selected CSV Files:** You have full control over your CSV files. You can access, modify, and delete these files directly from your device's storage using your device's file manager. The App does not keep separate copies of this data outside of your chosen file location unless you explicitly use a cloud sync feature.
*   **Firebase Analytics Data:** Data collected by Firebase Analytics is retained according to Google's data retention policies. You can often manage some data collection preferences through your device settings or Google account settings. You may also be able to reset your Advertising ID on your Android device.

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no electronic transmission or storage of information is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own vocabulary files on your device.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
